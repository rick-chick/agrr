# Litestream configuration for Cloud Storage replication (Development Environment)
# Separate databases for primary, queue, cache, and cable for better performance
# Uses separate GCS bucket from production to avoid conflicts
# All paths are prefixed with 'development/' to ensure complete separation
dbs:
  # Main application database
  - path: storage/development.sqlite3
    replicas:
      - type: gcs
        bucket: ${GCS_BUCKET_DEV}
        path: development/primary.sqlite3
        sync-interval: 10s
  
  # Solid Queue database
  - path: storage/development_queue.sqlite3
    replicas:
      - type: gcs
        bucket: ${GCS_BUCKET_DEV}
        path: development/queue.sqlite3
        sync-interval: 10s
  
  # Solid Cache database (optional backup - cache can be recreated)
  - path: storage/development_cache.sqlite3
    replicas:
      - type: gcs
        bucket: ${GCS_BUCKET_DEV}
        path: development/cache.sqlite3
